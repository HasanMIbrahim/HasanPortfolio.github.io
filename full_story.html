        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>Greetings! I'm Hasan Ibrahim, a results-driven Engineer with a passion for optimizing RF network performance and a 
            proven track record in implementing tailored solutions for clients. Over the years, my journey has been marked by a profound
             appreciation for the power of data-driven decision-making.     <br />       
             <br />
                                                                                           
                In my role as a Radio Frequency/Network Engineer, I've successfully led end-to-end migrations, 
             integrated environmental cell site alarms, and played a pivotal role in projects like the 10G uplift,
             enhancing network capacity and performance. Proficient in layer-2/3 protocols and data analytics, 
            I've developed fast and secure infrastructure plans for facilities and networking hubs.
             <br />
             <br />
             As my career evolved, I found myself increasingly drawn to the transformative world of data analysis. 
             The experience gained in supporting the new build construction projects of cell phone towers for Verizon Wireless
             exposed me to the intricacies of data analytics such as data collection, reporting and predictive analysis. This exposure, coupled with
              my proficiency in tools like SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power Pivots, has ignited a keen interest in transitioning into a full-time Data Analyst role.
              <br />
              <br />
               In pursuit of this goal, I am excited to embark on the next chapter of my professional journey as a full-time Data Analyst.
               I am enthusiastic about applying my analytical proficiency, technical skills, and problem-solving acumen to uncover valuable insights that 
               drive informed decision-making.
               <br />
               <br />
              This portfolio serves as a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and my commitment to delivering excellence in every endeavor. 
              I invite you to explore my projects and experiences, and I am open to
               collaborations that allow me to further hone my skills as I transition into the realm of data analysis.
